# logic-circuit--simulator
its a cpp project which read the data from .txt file and simulate the work of logic circuit  and print the output of it
# supported logic gates 
and 
nand
or 
nor 
not 
# data.txt  file format 
* add logic gates 

"logic gate name"  input1 name  input2 name ,,etc  * output node name  

*  set value to inputs 
set node name  value 
* simulate the whole circuts 
 sim  
* print  specific node 
 out node name 
 *print all node 
 out *
