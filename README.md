# logic-circuit--simulator
its a cpp project which read the data from .txt file and simulate the work of logic circuit  and print the output of it
# supported logic gates 
and 
nand
or 
nor 
not 
# file format 
1. add logic gates 
"logic gate name"  input1 name  input2 name ,,etc  * output node name  

2. set value to inputs 
set node name  value 
 3. simulate the whole circuts 
  simulate 
  4. print  specific node 
out node name 
5. print all node 
 out *
